# Feed Reader Testing

This is one of the projects required by the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. For this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and told to write a series of unit tests against the webapp using the Jasmine Test Framework.

## How to Run

In order to run the webapp and execute the unit tests simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The Jasmine panel will appear below the webpage and will show any errors, if any. If all tests pass it should print "7 specs, 0 failures", with a list of all tests that were run underneath.
